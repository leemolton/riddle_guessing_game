Welcome to the Riddles Quiz Game

Do you like solving riddles? If you do, come and try my project! This is a simple riddles quiz game where users can log in 
and answer a variety of riddles from simple riddles to more complex ones. Users can log in with a unique username 
and compete with your friends to see how high you can get on the leaderboard, have a look today and give it a go. More than one person can play at the same time.

UX
This riddles quiz is for anyone of all ages to have a go at and compete against each other. The main aim is to get
the user's brain working and help them increase their lateral thinking.


Features
The primary feature of this project is to answer riddles and see how high they can move up the leaderboard. The user answers
a riddle and then progresses to the next one when the correct answer is inputted. 


Technologies Used



Testing
This project has been tested to ensure that it works. It has been manually tested by inputting a user name and then answering a few riddles.
Also, assertion tests have been created to test the basic functionality of the riddle game. The opening of a file and writing to it
has been tested as the correct and incorrect answers are added to separate files in the riddle game. Finally, the file is tested to 
ensure it is empty before the quiz is started. All of these tests successfully passed. I encountered a few bugs when testing as all of
the answers were going into the one file regardless of whether they were correct or incorrect. This has now been addressed and the
answers now go into the correct file.


Deployment
To deploy this project, a Github page was created to store all of my pages. The different commits are also explained to show the different
stages of the project. The quiz game has also been deployed on the Heroku website to visually run the quiz.
