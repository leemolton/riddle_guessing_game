Brothers and sisters I have none but this man's father is my father's son.
Who is the man? 
The answer is simple - the man is my son.

What is greater than God,
more evil than the devil,
the poor have it,
the rich need it,
and if you eat it, you'll die?
NOTHING

Who makes it, has no need of it.
Who buys it, has no use for it. 
Who uses it can neither see nor feel it. 
What is it?
A COFFIN

What can travel around the world while staying in a corner?
A STAMP

What gets broken without being held?
A PROMISE
